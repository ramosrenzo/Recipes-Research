## Introduction

In this project, we are exploring the Recipes and Ratings datasets.  By analyzing this dataset,
we are hoping to find the answer to the question: Do recipes with higher preparation time have higher ratings?
for recipes?  By finding the answer to this question, we may be able to draw conclusions about why
a recipe received a low or high rating just based on the preparation time of the recipe.  The Recipes
and Ratings datasets contain 83782 and 731927 rows, respectively.  We are mainly interested in
utilizing the columns: 'minutes' and 'rating'.  The 'minutes' column is found on the Recipes dataset
and it uses an integer value to display the prep time for a recipe (in minutes).  The 'rating' column is 
found on the Ratings dataset, and also uses an integer value to display ratings that has been given to a 
unique 'recipe_id'

## Cleaning and EDA

Before we can start the analysis of the recipe and rating data, we must clean it to ensure that our analysis is as smooth and accurate as possible. 

> The Merge
We merged the recipe and the interaction data into one data frame to make the process of analysis easier. We merged the data frames on the columns that they share in common which are “recipe id” and “id”. 

> Fill in Missing Data Appropriately
After exploring the columns to look for missing data, we decided to leave missing strings as the default because replacing them with empty strings is not the best way to handle this type of missing data. We did however notice that there are missing values for ratings which is important in our analysis, so we decided to fill the missing values with zeros. 

> Finding the Average Rating
After combining the data frames and filling in missing values, we calculate the average ratings for each recipe with its unique ID. We calculate this to have averages rather than multiple ratings for each recipe because the average rating is more informative. 

> The Second Merge
We then conduct a second merge with the original recipe data and the average ratings we calculated in the step before. We only care about the ratings from the interactions data set so this is why it is now left out of the further analysis. 

> The Time Bins
The last step in the process of cleaning and preparing our data for analysis is to create bin intervals of 30 minutes. For each interval of 30 minutes, each unique recipe is assigned a number according to the minutes of the recipe. For example, a recipe between 0 and 30 minutes is assigned bin 1, a recipe taking 31 to 60 minutes is assigned bin 2, etc. Our last bin is from 721 minutes to infinity. We decided to have this as our last bin as 720 minutes represents 12 hours. 

> Cleaning Result
Below is the cleaned dataframe

### Univariate Analysis

<iframe src="assets/rating_hist.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Average Rating Distribution
In this chart, we see the distribution of the average ratings for each unique recipe. It is left-skewed showing that there are many more recipes with a 5-star rating.

<iframe src="assets/time_hist.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Recipe Time Distribution
This distribution shows the number of unique recipes and which bin they are assigned to according to the minutes. There are a lot more recipes within the 0 to 90 minute mark; bins 1, 2, and 3. This shows a left-skew in the data and a significant cut-off in recipes that go over the 90-minute mark. 

### Bivariate Analysis

<iframe src="assets/rating_time_box.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Average Rating Versus Preparation Time
In this visual, we see boxplots for each time bin and the average ratings. We see that the bins with the highest average rating median are the first 8 bins. We also see that the bins with the lowest medians are bins 10 through 19.
