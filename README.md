# The Effect of Prep Time on a Recipe's Average Rating
Catherine Back, Lorenzo Ramos

Data Science project for DSC80 at UCSD

## Introduction

In this project, we are exploring the Recipes and Ratings datasets.  By analyzing this dataset,
we are hoping to find the answer to the question: Does the preparation time affect average ratings 
for recipes?  By finding the answer to this question, we may be able to draw conclusions about why
a recipe received a low or high rating just based on the preparation time of the recipe.  The Recipes
and Ratings datasets contain 83782 and 731927 rows, respectively.  We are mainly interested in
utilizing the columns: 'minutes' and 'rating'.  The 'minutes' column is found on the Recipes dataset
and it uses an integer value to display the prep time for a recipe (in minutes).  The 'rating' column is 
found on the Ratings dataset, and also uses an integer value to display ratings that has been given to a 
unique 'recipe_id'
